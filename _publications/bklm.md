excerpt: 'Can trade frictions limit access to improved health technologies? Rwanda encouraged and licensed domestic production of high-quality masks by a few selected textile manufacturers at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We exploit spatial variation in exposure to mask manufacturing through pre-licensing medical and textile trade networks within an event-study design using receipt-level transaction data. Local markets less exposed to mask manufacturing had higher mask prices, purchased fewer masks, and experienced faster growth in COVID-19 infections proxied by demand for anti-fever medicine.The dynamics of our results suggest that mask quality, rather than quantity, explains reduced infections caused by manufactured masks.'
